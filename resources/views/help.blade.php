                    <p>Perhaps. Inactive Pibbble accounts may be renamed or removed at our discretion. We will not rename or remove an active account except in the case of name squatting, which is prohibited. You can request a username for an account that appears inactive, but please note that not all activity on Pibbble is publicly visible.

                    Pibbble usernames are provided on a first-come, first-served basis, and are intended for immediate and active use. Usernames may not be inactively held for future use.

                    Attempts to buy, sell, or solicit other forms of payment in exchange for Pibbble accounts or usernames are prohibited and may result in account suspension or removal.</p>
